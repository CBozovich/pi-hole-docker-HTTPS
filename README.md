✅ Assigns a static IP on the LAN (e.g., `192.168.1.137`)  
✅ Uses `host` networking for compatibility with Wi-Fi  
✅ Enables HTTPS on the Pi-hole admin portal using self-signed certificates  
✅ Adds curated blocklists for ads, trackers, malware, and more  
✅ Automatically starts on boot

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Pi-hole
- lighttpd webserver
- OpenSSL (for self-signed certs)
